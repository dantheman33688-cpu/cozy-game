## Frequently Asked Questions

### Overcoming the 30-Second Time Pressure?
The 30-second timer is both thrilling and punishing. Many players report frustration at the mental pressure it creates. To stay composed, treat your first few seconds as setup time: identify targets, plan your launch, then commit confidently.
Practicing mindfulness and breathing control can improve your reaction under stress. With repetition, the countdown becomes a motivator rather than an obstacle — sharpening your reflexes and boosting efficiency.

### Solving Precise Control Difficulties and Minor Bugs
Adjust your screen sensitivity in the settings menu.
Play with consistent finger placement to build muscle memory.
Use a stylus if your touchscreen struggles with accuracy.
Developers have acknowledged minor input lag and trajectory misalignment bugs. Until patched, patience and recalibration remain your best defense.

### Addressing Difficulty Spikes and IAP/Ad Fairness
Some players express concern over sudden difficulty spikes and perceived imbalance between free and paid users. While Thorn Ball remains free-to-play, in-app purchases (IAPs) like extra time or hint systems can tilt the challenge. To maintain fairness, focus on honing skill and level memory.
Ads between levels can disrupt rhythm; many users recommend playing offline or purchasing the ad-free upgrade. Despite these issues, the community agrees that Thorn Ball’s deep mechanics make it one of the most rewarding physics puzzle games available.
