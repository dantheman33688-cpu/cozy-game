      1. **Prepare Drinks**: This is the main action of the game. When customers place an order, you must quickly head to the coffee machine to prepare their drinks.\n
      2. **Tidy Up Tables**: This is the efficiency task. After a customer finishes their drink, you'll need to clean the table before another customer can sit.\n
      3. **Collect Money**: The reward part of the loop. After serving drinks and cleaning tables, collect money from satisfied customers to fuel your café's expansion.\n
      These three tasks will form the foundation of your gameplay experience.`,
