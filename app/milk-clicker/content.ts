Unlike most idle clickers, its unique “One-Price Shop” (OPS) mechanic fundamentally transforms how you plan upgrades and balance Milk Per Second (MPS) and Milk Per Click (MPC). To master the game, you must understand how to leverage OPS efficiency, optimize your timing, and prepare for long-term scaling through prestige and automation.",
