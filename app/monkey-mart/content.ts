            "Production and Replenishment: The main cycle of Monkey Mart revolves around production, stocking, and restocking. You'll begin with basic farming (bananas, corn, and milk), which serves as the backbone of your store. As these items are harvested, you need to quickly replenish shelves to ensure you never run out of stock.",
            "Monetization and Growth: As you sell your products, cash begins to flow into your coffers. But simply earning money isn't enough‚Äîsmart reinvestment is key. Spend your earnings wisely on staff hires and upgrades, and use your revenue to unlock new equipment and expanded store features to grow your Monkey Mart empire.",
            "The Power of Automation: Hiring staff members (like cashiers and stockers) plays a pivotal role in automating your store's operations. This allows you to delegate essential tasks, freeing you up to focus on expansion and higher-level strategic decisions."

            "Inventory Mastery: The best Monkey Mart managers know how to keep high-demand items well-stocked. Missing out on popular products means missing out on sales, which can be devastating to your bottom line. Use your staff wisely to keep shelves stocked and ensure your customers' needs are met.",
            "The Early Storage Advantage: One of the most crucial early-game strategies is upgrading your storage capacity. Expanding your storage early on helps you prevent inventory overflow, saving you from the costly headache of managing insufficient storage. This upgrade is key to keeping your store running smoothly and efficiently.",
            "Staff Training ROI: Hiring new staff is only half the battle. Regularly training your employees boosts their efficiency and helps reduce the time they take to complete their tasks. This, in turn, leads to faster checkout times and more satisfied customers.",
            "Customer Satisfaction & Scoring: Customer satisfaction is directly tied to your store's efficiency. Monitoring customer wait times is essential to achieving a high score. A well-oiled machine with minimal delays keeps customers happy, which leads to greater earnings.",

            "First Upgrades Priority: Invest early in character speed and storage upgrades. Speed upgrades help you move around the store faster, while increasing your storage capacity gives you more room for products, preventing overflow.",
            "First Hires: Hiring staff early is a smart move, but be strategic. Start with an early cashier or stocker to reduce your workload. These first hires will significantly boost your efficiency by handling the busy tasks of stock replenishment and checkout."

            "Investment Balancing: At this stage of the game, it's important to balance your spending. New equipment, staff upgrades, and character attributes should all be prioritized based on what your store needs most. If you're managing a large operation, staff upgrades may be a higher priority than new equipment.",
            "Integrating Automation: Introducing advanced devices like the microwave or yogurt machine is key to scaling your business. These machines automate production processes, helping you produce more goods with less human input. The right balance of automation can lead to higher profits and more efficient operations."
