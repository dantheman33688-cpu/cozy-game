              Mastering Launch Power and Angle Precision
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              The foundation of success in <strong>Thorn Ball</strong> lies in understanding and controlling the launch mechanics.
              Every shot begins with the pull-back mechanic, which determines your launch power. The further you pull back, the stronger
              the launch ‚Äî but precision is everything.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              To adjust the launch angle, use a diagonal slide motion on your screen. Combining the right angle with the perfect amount
              of power ensures your thorn ball travels efficiently, reaching even the most scattered balloons.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Players aiming for consistent high scores must develop muscle memory for both controls. Experiment in early levels to understand
              how small variations affect your trajectory ‚Äî this practice pays off when tackling advanced puzzles later on.

            The Physics of Wall Bounces and Chain Reactions üîÅ

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Thorn Ball‚Äôs physics system rewards players who think beyond direct hits. Each wall bounce changes your trajectory,
              allowing you to reach hidden or protected balloons.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Advanced players use calculated rebounds to create chain reactions, where one shot pops multiple clusters. Observe how
              your ball‚Äôs speed decreases slightly with each bounce, and plan to use walls to deflect toward dense groups of balloons.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              For pro-level play, anticipate your second and third bounces before launching. When mastered, these techniques lead to
              satisfying, high-efficiency clears ‚Äî essential for leaderboard domination.

              To achieve record-breaking scores, prioritize precision and speed equally. A methodical yet quick approach yields both

                Among the community‚Äôs most celebrated feats is the one-shot clearance ‚Äî completing a level with a single,

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Start by identifying balloon clusters and obstacle gaps, then test launch power in small increments to map the

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Harder stages often scatter balloons across complex patterns, demanding fast, adaptive thinking. You have only

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Focus first on trajectory visualization: before launching, trace an imaginary line through the densest clusters
                or toward bounce-friendly walls.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Use environmental assists such as walls or moving platforms to execute trick shots. By aiming slightly off-center,
                you can initiate long ricochets that clean up multiple targets at once.
